/**
 * A Base GAS Actor class
 * 
 * NOT TESTED YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 * Code in this class is not just copied from the AbilitySystemCharacter class. The AbilitySystemActor class has a specific implementation that differs a little from the AbilitySystemCharacter class.
 *
 * Some tips:
 *		1) Levels
 *			- Always passed in as 1 because this template does not come with a level system. GetLevel() is what you should make if your wanting a level system. This is commented out at all places where the level is passed in. since no player will ever possess this actor and the ASC always lives on here, you can put the GetLevel() function in this class.
 *		2) Abilities
 *			- If you have a starting ability just override GrantStartingAbilities() and call Super in the beginning, then add your own logic
 *		3) Attribute Sets
 *			- Subclasses should override RegisterAttributeSets() and call the Super at the beginning if they would like to add more attribute sets than the default pawn one
 *		4) Gameplay Effects
 *			- Every actor should initialize their attributes through the DefaultAttributeValuesEffect GameplayEffectTSub in BP.
 *			- Any gameplay effects that this actor should have on spawn should be filled in in the EffectsToApplyOnStartup TArray in BP. (ie. GE_HealthRegen or GE_StaminaRegen)
 *		5) Gmeplay Tags
 *			- Nothing special here
 *		6) Respawning
 *			- You can have a respawning system for this actor without destroying the actor or its ASC. Just reset its ASC using the custom function we wrote in the base ASC class FullReset() and also set bAttributesAndStartupEffectsInitialized to false so you can initialize again using SetupWithAbilitySystem(). This however assumes that all that needs to be reset for the actor is the stuff belonging to the ASC (ie. its AttributeSets). If more needs to be reset you can just add it

	 * Set to true if you want this actor to reference another actor's ability system component rather than creating its own. Ex: A weapon with its ActorAbilitySystemComponent set to the player state's ASC.
	 * Note: This will require some custom work in the subclass. Ex: in our weapon class, in OnRep_Owner() we set the weapon's ActorAbilitySystemComponent to the owner's (casted to an AbilitySystemCharacter) ASC.
	 * Note: Make sure you set ActorAbilitySystemComponent before SetupWithAbilitySystem() is called. To do this, you will most likely have to override PostInitializeComponents() and call AAbilitySystemActor::Super::PostInitializeComponents(). This
	 * skips the SetupWithAbilitySystem() and it is your job to call it elsewhere (some time after you set ActorAbilitySystemComponent).
