- Make CMC read movement values from an attribute set.
- Make the example ability for the ExampleAbilitySystemCharacter more unusual than GA_Fire because it needs to emphasise that it's a specific ability to that one character.
- Change the "GetLevel() doesn't exist in this template. Will need to implement one if you want a level system" comment so that it works without it being a template
- Add a UE_LOG if NewAbility is null in GrantAbility:
	- UE_LOG(LogAbilitySystemSetup, Error, TEXT("Could'nt grant ability. NewAbility was null"));
- Add a DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FSetupWithAbilitySystemCompleted); in AbilitySystemCharacter.h.
	- Also do this kind of thing for the AbilitySystemPawn and AbilitySystemActor
- Fix gameplay ability UE_LOGs
	- the character run ability logs say jump instead of run
- Allow developer to specify multible DefaultAttributeValues GEs. Good for organization (ie. GE for movement attributes and one for damage attributes)
- Add message log by default for game template
- In GTCharacter, change the setup attachments to GetCapsuleComponent() instead of RootComponent
- Git rid of kismetsystemlibrary include in middle of abilitysystemcharacter code
- Maybe uncomment the PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = false; to more strongly enforce
- Make UAT_RepeatAction
- Change the BAA_ classes to use a Gampelaytask instead. We had a discussion about this in the GAS discord and someone converted it without any weird problems.
- Move as much checks as you can from AcivateAbility into CanActivateAbility so that we can get activation rollback.
- In GTGameplayAbility, change implementation for ActivateAbility(). Shouldn't cancel ability if no valid prediction key. Also wrap it in an if check to make sure the NetExecutionPolicy is set to LocalPredicted for that logic to occur.
- For the Abilities we have, move the if (CommitAbility) check to be the last check
- Implement a way to be able to easily add passive abilities in the character BP. Also modify GrantAbility to be able to activate ability on grant. Also make GTGameplayAbility override OnAvatarSet() to activate the ability if a bool is true
- Move CMC movement variables to CharacterAttributeSet.h
- Add CollisionChannels.h or something like that
- GASShooter has a custom subclass of AGameplayAbilityTargetActor and a new WaitTargetDataWithReusableActor AbilityTask written from scratch that allows you to reuse a TargetActor without destroying it.
- In AbilitySystemActor::AbilitySystemActor() call SetReplicates(true);

-------------------------------------
An ideal solution to these 2 problems would mean the server wouldn't have to wait on the client to finish SetupWithAbilitySystem() (remove the client->server RPC all together) to Grant Abilities.
- Make the server grant the abilities only after client character is spawned (and idealy possessed). Don't do a server RPC to tell server to grant abilities!!!
	- Idealy we would want to grant the abilities in SetupWithAbilitySystem() on the server but last time we had it that way, OnAvatarSet() would be called 3 times some reason and give us a null reference.
- PreApplyStartupEffects in AbilitySystemCharacter/Pawn/Actor is currently server only. We tried to make it also on client but then put it back to server only because it is unpredicatble where it is needed to be broadcasted since the server replicating the effect to the client. The effect replicated to client too fast before it can broadcast to classes can bind to it. Make PreApplyStartupEffects work on client too. (as a quick note, we did not implement this in SonicShooter. We tried but couldn't find any way. But we want to find a solution to this for GameTemplate)
	- This is needed because we would like to be able to bind to attribute/tag change delegates BEFORE startup effects are applied.
-------------------------------------

- Modify AbilitySystemCharacter and copy it to the pawn version.
- Add CollisionChannels.h (only public header -no cpp) to the Utilities folder
- Maybe add a GTAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary
	- Need this is we want custom GameplayTargetDataFilters


- Consider adding confirm and cancel integers to the constructor of FGameplayAbilityInputBinds() in AAbilitySystemCharacter::BindASCInput()
	- FGameplayAbilityInputBinds(FString("ConfirmTarget"), FString("CancelTarget"), FString("EAbilityInputID"), static_cast<int32>(EAbilityInputID::Confirm), static_cast<int32>(EAbilityInputID::Cancel))
	- If I remember we chose not to do this because we didn't want confirm and cancel in the EAbilityInputID enum but just review this idea anyways

- Document that AbilitySystemCharacter is not meant to be used as a base class but rather a tool for base classes to use

- Add message log in saved after outputlog

- Take AS_PlayerState out of AttributeSets folder and delete the folder

- Add GTGameplayAbilityTargetActor base class and add our own AT_WaitTargetData that uses our base target actor instead
- Update all abilities to replicate CancelAbility() if a check in ActivateAbility() is NULL (unless if bRespectsRemoteAbilityToCancel=true)

- Make ActorAbilitySystemComponent protected rather than private in AbilitySystemActor

- Add bWithoutAbilitySystemComponentAsSubobject and the necessary checks to make it work
	- Look at SonicSiege's AbilitySystemActor.cpp

- Make SetupWithAbilitySystem(), InitializeAttribute(), and ApplyStartupEffects() protected (rather than private) in the AbilitySystemActor so that if a subclass is using bWithoutAbilitySystemComponentAsSubobject, he can call SetupWithAbilitySystem() on his own.

- Get rid of example ability ActorAbilitySpecHandle and ActorAbilityTSub and put it in an ExampleAbilitySystemActor
	- Or just put a comment above all references to these variables and mention that it's an example ability
- Get rid of example ability PawnAbilitySpecHandle and PawnAbilityTSub and put it in an ExampleAbilitySystemPawn
	- Or just put a comment above all references to these variables and mention that it's an example ability
	- Idk if pawn has this problem but even if it doesn't make an ExampleAbilitySystemPawn with an example ability

- Fix UE_CLOG in RegisterAttributeSets to be more specific by getting rid of the && condition eliminating the "either" in the log
	- break it into 2 if statements somehow?
	- figure out how to make it look clean still

- Fix thing where if CMC exceeds save move buffer the character becomes completely in the wrong place and its not accounted for
- Add AT_WaitInputPressCust
- Add AT_WaitInputReleaseCust
- Add AT_PlayMontageAndWaitCust

- AbilitySystemActor "ActorAttributeSet" IS NOT ON EVERY ACTOR". Name misleading
- Update GrantAbility() UELOG to give the function name

- Figure out if we should UPROPERTY major objects or not (garbage collection related)
- Make sure we have parenthesese after all of our function names in out comments (so that we can peek definition on them - without parentheses peek definition doesn't work)

- Use CanActivateAbility more rather than doing checks in activate ability (if possible) (also look at SS's improved GA_CharacterRun with more checks in CanActivateAbility)

- Change the "State" tags to be sub-categories. The reason for this is because we are going to have a Character category which would make it so that there is a Character category and a State.Character category which is annoying because now you have two character categories
	- Make State.Character to Character.State
	- Make State.Player to Player.State

- Add macro fro FLAG_WantsToRun and all necessary custom flags
- Get rid of forward declaration parameters in cmc

- Get rid of "this oculd be causing the TEnumAsByte warnings" comment in CMC cpp

- Add client rpc system for CMC (that we have in SS) that corrects custom data on the client
	- Make it adjust bCanRun and stuff
- Basically copy and paste entire CMC from sonic siege and pick out what you dont want

- Rename BlueprintsForTesting to just "testing" or something else

- get rid of comment in CMC	"//legacy? (this oculd be causing the TEnumAsByte warnings)"
- Fix CMC->SetWantsToRun(True/False) being client authoritative. Same with all movement things.
- Add pktlag comment option in default engine ini



- Take out the " * GetWorld()->GetDeltaSeconds()" in HorizontalLook and VerticalLook and set sensitivities to 1
	- idk why but the delta seconds has the opposite effect of what you would expect
	- take the code from the Vertical and Horizontal Look methods in SSCharacter



- make crouch not affect mesh or camera by override OnStartCrouch and OnEndCrouch

- make smooth camera crouching by using the FCrouchTickFunction and CrouchTick()


- Change all CancelAbility()s in our abilities to EndAbility()s because CancelAbility() is meant for external sources while EndAbility() is made to be called by the ability itself.
- Also ensure that we are replicating the end ability for all of these (for some reason a lot of them weren't)


- Add CMC system for having a true value for each flag. EX: bIsRunning for bWantsToRun. look at UpdateCharacterStateBeforeMovement()


- Make CMC and character return true for can jump if the character is crouched
- Make GA_CharacterRun cancel GA_Crouch, GA_Crouch cancel GA_CharacterRun, and GA_CharacterJump cancel GA_Crouch


- Change all of the "CurrentActorInfo", "CurrentAvatarActor", and "CurrentActivationInfo" in every activate ability to "ActorInfo", "AvatarActor", "ActivationInfo"



- Add our own WaitNetSync for ServerWait that will stop waiting after a period of time

- Make a UGameplayEffect_DefaultAttributes and make a virtual SetSoftAttributeDefaults in GTAttributeSet that is called whenever a UGameplayEffect_DefaultAttributes is applied
	- Copy implementation of SonicShooter (we have nice documentation and stuff)
	- Make our existing attribute sets implement this workflow

- Go through each EndAbility() and decide whether the client should replicate end ability or not (most likely not). If not, ensure only the autority calls the EndAbility() with bReplicateEndAbility to true while the client runs the EndAbility with it false. See example in SS abilities

- Make movement abilities call the move functions on the cmc
	- Get rid of the movement abilities determining the WantsTo values

- fix CMC's jump system (make bIsJumping)

- maybe add crouch ability to AbilitySystemCharacter, or take Jump and Run out of it and into a subclass with crouch


- add NetSecurityPolicy = EGameplayAbilityNetSecurityPolicy::ServerOnlyTermination in base GA (at the time we only knew about bServerRespectsRemoteAbilityCancellation, maybe this is a new property, idk but its awesome)

- Fix CMC documentation

- Add bJumpDisabled and bCrouchDisabled tags for CMC

- Make root folder for GameTemplate and add 3DObjects and Tools as subfolders along side GameTemplate subfolder (the one that has the actual uproject)
	- Add contents of Tools

- For the UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton, in RetargetManager, in Set up Rig, set the Select Rig to Humanoid so that we can retarget this skeleton's anims to other skeletons
- Add our BlenderMannequin for importing blender animations to be retargeted to the mannequin skeleton
	- Including a version of the mannequin that uses our BlenderMannequin
- Add BlenderMannequin to the 3DObjects folder
	- The blend files and the fbx





































- Add BaseUMG class















- (JUST AN IDEA) make bool for having abilities transfer over between AIAbilitySystemComponent and PlayerAbilitySystemComponent in AbilitySystemCharacter
- (ALSO JUST AN IDEA) make our own AIController and store the AIAbilitySystemComponent on that?




- Fix GrantAbility(). Sometimes we may want 2 of the same abilities, maybe compare the Specs before returning out?
