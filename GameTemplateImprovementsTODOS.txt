- Make CMC read movement values from an attribute set.
- Make the example ability for the ExampleAbilitySystemCharacter more unusual than GA_Fire because it needs to emphasise that it's a specific ability to that one character.
- Change the "GetLevel() doesn't exist in this template. Will need to implement one if you want a level system" comment so that it works without it being a template
- Add a UE_LOG if NewAbility is null in GrantAbility: UE_LOG(LogAbilitySystemSetup, Error, TEXT("Could'nt grant ability. NewAbility was null"));
