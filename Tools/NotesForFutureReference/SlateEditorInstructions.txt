To make this work you have to use the "File > NewFromFolder" way
1) "File > NewFromFolder"
2) Select folder with the individual frame files (I used pngs)
3) Right click on the red folder at the bottom right of the screen and click "Restore To This"
4) Go to "Texture Layout" tab in the very top left corner and adjust "X" and "Y" options under the "Tiling" section until the frames aren't stretched and they look the correct dimentions.
5) Select the OpticalFlow tab in the top left and click "Generate All"
6) Check to see if the optical flow generated correctly by switching the view layer from "Default" to "OpticalFlow" (located at the middle top of the screen)
7) Now export the OpticalFlow layer by going to the "LayerSettings" tab on the right of the screen and click "Export Layer Tiles" under the OpticalFlow layer section

The optical flow frames should be saved in a new folder called "Frames" that is created inside the folder you selected at the beginning.


What we were doing wrong:
	- The optical flow doesn't generate anything if the "X" and "Y" options under the "Tiling" section don't make a perfect square
		- Also if it isn't a perfect square the frames get stretched
		- So if we wanted to upload just a sprite sheet instead of a folder with lots of frames, we would have to make the resolution of that sprite sheet a perfect square too. Only problem with doing the sprite sheet way is it tries to save it in a folder that needs admin rights, so you can't export. And even if you run with admin it doesn't work because then a different problem happens where the optical flow doesn't generate anything (not 100% sure if this is because you are runnig as admin or not but it seems to be that way)
